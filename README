Xeer1update
======================

Simple bash script for Xen Server 6.5 SP1

- Downloads updates.xml from xenserver and parses it.
- Sorts patches by timestamp and after that by filename in case that there is 2 with the same time stamp.
- Downloads and installs all missing patches
- If the zip files are already downloaded, it will not download them again.
- After the installation it removes the source and the xsupdate files, but leaves the zip files. If have other servers you can copy the zip versions
- Uses xe patch clean to to try to save some extra space
To use it run
